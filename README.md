## Task:

Create a square matrix of size MxM, where M is an integer from the range [2,5]. The specific size of the matrix is set by the user. The matrix contains only integers from the range [1, 100], which can be either random or entered by the user. Sort in descending order the elements belonging to or lying below the main diagonal of the matrix, multiply the remaining elements by minus one. The results of matrix processing are displayed on the screen.

###### P.S. I have wrote it on C without using any built-in functions because it is task. I decided that C is the most suitable language for this task because it has a minimum of built-in functions I could use.
